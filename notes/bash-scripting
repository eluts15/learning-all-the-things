- What is bash good for?
    - Light tasks for automation
    - doing backups
    - 

- Not for writing complex object oriented software

- Use Shell scripting where appropriate
    - if you are running 100 line bash files, it should be done in python/ruby

- Things to be comfortable with
    - pipes
    - file descriptors: stdin, stdout, etc.
    - writing something in a shell and redirecting to a file

- Write something easy to read rather than clever and hard to read.

- Bash & Programming
    - cat hello.txt | wc -l

- Variables and Quoting
    - echo $HOME -- /home/eth0 the same as /home/usr/

    - some_number=10
    - echo $some_number -- 10

- Starts to get weird....
    - echo "This is my ${somenumber} beer!

- Command Substitution

-- Practical case: Get the number of lines in /path/to/file
    - Example:
        echo "there are X number of lines in /etc/shadow file" 
        echo "there are 70 number of lines in /etc/shadow file"

        $ num_lines=`ls $HOME | wc -l`
        output: 13

-- Scripting

source is not the same as ./
