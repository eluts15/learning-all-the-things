Administrating Linux 

Useful things to know about when dealing with User accounts.
Scenerios might include:
    - creating new users
    - disabling old users who no longer require access.
    - setting up a users home directory

Use sudo -i to login as the root user.
On linux systems, the relevent files can be found under 
    - etc/passwd
    - etc/shadow
    - etc/group
    - etc/skel

Run tail /etc/passwd
To display the current logged in users.  Most of these users are used by the system.
! symbol can be used to disable a user account.

This can be done by doing the following:

#Create a directory on home, specify directory and the default shell.
useradd -m -d /home/ethan -s /bin/bash ethan

# To view the changes, the user has been created, but is locked and no passowd has been set.
tail /etc/shadow 

# Setting the password with passwd
passwd ethan

# Now the ! will be removed and the passwod for the chosen user will be set.

# Locking a user account.
usermod -L ethan

# Unlocking a user account.
usermod -U ethan

# Deleting user
userdel ethan

# This will delete the user account, but you still need to delete the home directory.
